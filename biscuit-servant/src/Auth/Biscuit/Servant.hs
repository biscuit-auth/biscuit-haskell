-- $presentation
--
-- Biscuit are bearer tokens that can be used to protect API endpoints.
-- This package provides utilities to protect servant endpoints with such
-- tokens.
--
-- The token will be extracted from the @Authorization@ header, and must
-- be base64-encoded, prefixed with the @Bearer @ string.

-- $apitypes
--
-- To protect an endpoint (or a whole API tree), you can use 'RequireBiscuit'
-- like so:
--
-- > type API = RequireBiscuit :> ProtectedAPI
-- > type ProtectedAPI =
-- >        "endpoint1" :> Get '[JSON] Int
-- >   :<|> "endpoint2" :> Capture "int" Int :> Get '[JSON] Int
-- >   :<|> "endpoint3" :> Get '[JSON] Int
-- >   :<|> "endpoint4" :> Get '[JSON] Int
-- >
-- > app :: PublicKey -> Application
-- > app publicKey =
-- >   -- servant needs access to the biscuit /public/
-- >   -- key to be able to check biscuit signatures.
-- >   -- The public key can be read from the environment
-- >   -- and parsed using 'parsePublicKeyHex' for instance.
-- >   serveWithContext
-- >     (Proxy :: Proxy API)

-- >     server
-- >

--
-- This will instruct servant to extract the biscuit from the requests and
-- check its signature. /It will not/, however, run any datalog check (as
-- the checks typically depend on the request contents).
--
-- $singleEndpointAuthorizer
--
-- The corresponding @Server API@ value will be a @Biscuit OpenOrSealed Verified -> Server ProtectedAPI@.
-- The next step is to provide a 'Authorizer' so that the biscuit datalog can be
-- verified. For that, you can use 'checkBiscuit' (or 'checkBiscuitM' for effectful checks).

-- $composableAuthorizers
--
-- 'checkBiscuit' allows you to describe validation rules endpoint by endpoint. If your

-- provided by servant-server that lets apply a transformation function to whole
-- API trees.

-- $tokenPostProcessing
--
-- By default, an `AuthorizedBiscuit` value is available through `MonadReader` in all
-- `WithAuthorizer` handlers. In many cases, a post-processing step is needed to extract
-- meaningful information from the token (for instance extracting a user id and then fetching
-- user information from the database). In order to avoid repeating this operation in every
-- endpoint, `withTransformation` allows to do it for whole API trees.
--
-- > handler4 :: WithAuthorizer Handler Int
-- > handler4 = withTransformation extractUserId $
-- >   withAuthorizer [authorizer|allow if user($user_id); |] $ do
-- >     userId <- ask -- we can access the extracted user id directly
-- >     pure userId
-- >
-- > -- given a @AuthorizedBiscuit OpenOrSealed@, we can extract information from
-- > -- the token. This step can perform effects (for instance `IO`, or `MonadError`).
-- > extractUserId :: AuthorizedBiscuit OpenOrSealed -> Handler Int
